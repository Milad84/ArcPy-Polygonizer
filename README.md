# ArcPy-Polygonizer
This script creates polygons across a selected network of streets keeping an eye on the intersection and by managing the size and shape of the polygons over the network of streets.

ArcPy Polygonizer (ArcGIS Pro / ArcPy 3.x)

Generate clean, attribute-rich street area polygons from a centerline network ‚Äî fast, reproducible, and resumable.
This implementation uses pairwise geoprocessing tools, a robust in-GDB near table, and FLAT-ended line buffers. The final layer contains a single street_levels field and an is_intersection flag.

Highlights

üîÅ Resumable: each stage can be skipped unless forced to rebuild.

üöÄ Fast: uses Pairwise* tools where available and runs with parallelProcessingFactor="100%".

üß≠ Robust topology: true intersections derived via GenerateNearTable stored in the GDB (not in_memory).

üß± FLAT caps on line buffers (legs and interconnects) to match baseline cartography.

üßæ Clean attributes: location_name, single street_levels, and is_intersection.

Requirements

ArcGIS Pro 3.x with ArcPy available.

Projected, feet-based coordinate system (default: EPSG 2277).

Access to Analysis tools used here:

PairwiseIntersect, PairwiseDissolve, PairwiseBuffer

GenerateNearTable

SpatialJoin, Merge, Dissolve, Buffer, Append

If a pairwise tool isn‚Äôt licensed, you can swap to the classic equivalent at a potential performance cost.

Input Assumptions

CTN_FC is a polyline centerline layer with:

STREET_LEVEL (integer or convertible text) used for widths & segmentation lengths.

A name field: prefers FULL_STREET_NAME, otherwise STREET_NAME.

Centerlines are reasonably snapped (default matching tolerance TOUCH_TOL = 5 ft).

Outputs

All outputs are written to the configured geodatabase.

Dataset	Type	Description
Polygonizer_BuiltIntersections	Point	Raw self-intersection candidates from PairwiseIntersect
Polygonizer_TrueIntersections	Point	Points with ‚â•2 incident streets within TOUCH_TOL
Polygonizer_IntersectionPolys	Polygon	Node cores + FLAT-ended leg buffers (unioned)
Polygonizer_InterconnectPolys	Polygon	Segmented FLAT-ended buffers between intersections
Polygonizer_FinalPolys	Polygon	Final merged surface with attributes

Final fields

location_name (TEXT, 250): comma-joined unique street names intersecting the polygon.

street_levels (TEXT, 50): sorted, comma-joined unique levels intersecting the polygon.

is_intersection (SHORT): 1 if polygon intersects ‚â•1 true-intersection point; otherwise 0.

The writer guarantees exactly one street_levels column.
